Having expanded out from the Game Boy, the WonderSwan is a wonderful handheld, but games are hard to come by, but I've solved how to create affordable replica carts with homebrew translations from Japanese to English.

- Romhacks and replicas - almost any game can be requested, £30 per cart, £25 for additional games + postage
- I have a few consoles in stock (WonderSwan Crystal, Color and Original)
- Backlight mod for original/BW WonderSwan
- Polarizer replacement/repair
- WonderSwan/WonderSwan Color repair - no power, no sound
- IPS mods, either as a send in upgrade, or all in one
