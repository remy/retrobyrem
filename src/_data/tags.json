    "description": "The Game Boy DMG IPS mod is 11% larger than the original LCD, low powered with customisable with 36 built in retro colour combinations and brightness control. This LCD is a formidable upgrade and has a full PCB replacement upgrading half of the entire contents of your Game Boy.\n\nAll models include a glass lens and are configurable from the original contrast wheel.\n\nThis is my personal favourite with the \"pixel mode\" enabled!\n\nNote that all these Game Boys are built on demand are on a first come first serve basis. I'll stay in touch via email to let you know the progress and with tracking details.\n\nCustom shells are also available: transparent, semi-transparent black, semi-transparent orange and blue - these are an additional Â£10, just email [remy@remysharp.com](mailto:remy@remysharp.com?subject=dmg%20shell%20upgrade)",

However when it comes to recording audio from the headphone output, the signal is actually weak and noisy.\n\nGB musician/hacker _Trash80_ is credited to have been the first to publish a modification where the **audio is directly taken at the line source**, before the headphone amplification. This **much cleaner** signal is then redirected to an external connection (mini-jack, jack, RCA, etc). This is what is called a Pro Sound mod."
