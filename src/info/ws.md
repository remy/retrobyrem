Having expanded out from the Game Boy, the WonderSwan is a wonderful handheld, but games are hard to come by, but I've solved how to create affordable replica carts with homebrew translations from Japanese to English.

- Replica cart - any game can be requested
- I have a few consoles in stock (WonderSwan Crystal, Color and Original)
- Backlight mod for original
- Polarizer replacement/repair
- WonderSwan/WonderSwan Color repair - no power, no sound
